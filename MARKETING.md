# Copy Company Marketing Strategy

## The Dogfooding Approach

Use Copy Company itself to market Copy Company. Every piece of content you create serves double duty: it markets the product AND demonstrates the product's capabilities. This is your strongest positioning lever.

---

## Brand Voice & Positioning

**Target Audience:** Solo creators, small business owners, and content marketers who need to produce consistent content across blog, newsletter, and social without hiring a team.

**Core Message:** "Stop juggling 5 tools. Write once, publish everywhere."

**Positioning Pillars:**
1. **AI-assisted writing** - Not AI-generated slop. AI that helps *you* write better and faster.
2. **One-to-many publishing** - Blog post becomes newsletter becomes social posts.
3. **Built-in audience growth** - Subscribers, custom domains, branded emails. No third-party newsletter tool needed.

---

## Content Strategy (Using Copy Company Features)

### Blog (Publishing via Copy Company's blog feature)

Publish 2-3x per week. Mix of:

**Pillar Content (1x/week):**
- Long-form guides that rank for search
- Topics: "How to repurpose a blog post into 10 social posts", "Newsletter growth strategies for solo creators", "Content calendar templates for consistent publishing"
- Use Content Sprints to generate topic ideas each month

**Product-Led Content (1x/week):**
- Show how Copy Company solves a real problem
- "How I publish to 5 platforms from one blog post" (walkthrough)
- "Setting up a branded newsletter in 10 minutes"
- "Using AI to go from idea to published post in 30 minutes"

**Short Takes (1x/week):**
- Quick tips, opinions, industry commentary
- "Why most content calendars fail", "The case for writing shorter newsletters"

### Newsletter (Using Copy Company's built-in newsletter)

**Frequency:** Weekly (same day/time for consistency)

**Format:**
- 1 actionable tip or insight (not just a blog recap)
- Link to the week's best blog post
- A "behind the scenes" section showing how you used Copy Company to create the week's content
- CTA: free trial or specific feature highlight

**Growth Tactics:**
- Embed subscribe forms on every blog post
- Lead magnet: "30 Days of Content Ideas" generated via Content Sprints
- Use custom email domain for deliverability and brand trust

### Social Media (Using Copy Company's atomize + scheduling)

**Platforms to prioritize (in order):**
1. **LinkedIn** - Primary. Your audience (creators, marketers, small biz) lives here.
2. **Instagram** - Visual content, behind-the-scenes, product demos.
3. **Facebook** - Community building, group participation.

**Workflow:**
1. Write blog post in Copy Company
2. Use "Atomize" to generate platform-specific social posts
3. Edit/refine the AI drafts (show that the AI assists, not replaces)
4. Schedule across platforms using Loops for recurring themes

**Content Mix for Social:**
- 40% Value posts (tips, frameworks, how-tos derived from blog content)
- 30% Product demonstrations (screen recordings, before/after, workflows)
- 20% Social proof (user wins, testimonials, case studies)
- 10% Personality/culture (team insights, building in public)

### Loops (Recurring Social Content)

Set up rotating content series:
- **"Tool Tip Tuesday"** - Weekly feature highlight
- **"Content Wins"** - Weekly user/personal success story
- **"Write Once, Publish Everywhere"** - Weekly workflow demonstration

---

## Growth Channels

## The Meta Advantage

Every piece of marketing content you create IS a product demo. When someone reads your blog, they're seeing the blog feature. When they get the newsletter, they're experiencing the newsletter feature. When they see consistent social posts, they're seeing the scheduling and atomize features at work.

Call this out explicitly: *"This blog post was written, published, and distributed to 3 platforms using Copy Company."* Add a subtle footer or CTA on every piece of content.
